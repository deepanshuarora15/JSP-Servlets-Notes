1. The implic classes objects ready to use in JSP are mentioned below:

a. PageContext pageContext
b. HttpSession session
c. ServletContext application
d. ServletConfig config
e. JspWriter out
f. Object page
g. JspWriter _jspx_out
h. PageContext _jspx_page_context

2.In Netbeans, whatever you write in JSP, can be seen in Servlet form as well.

3. Anything that is written inside 
   <% %> becomes  a part of the service() method call in equiavalent servlet

4. But 
   <%
    int i = 9;
   %>
   this does not become a part of the declaration in servlet. This also goes inside the service() method call.
