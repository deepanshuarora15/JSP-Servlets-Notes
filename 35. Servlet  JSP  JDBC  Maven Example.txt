1. Controller is implemented with help of servlets.
2. Models via POJOs
3. View via JSPs
4. Imp: In sendRedirect(), we have to enter data into session. We cannot forward data.
   In case of RequestDispatcher, we can forward the data to another page.
5. In case of sendRedirect(), there are 2 requests. One from client to s1, and then response from s1 to browser and then request from 
   browser to s2. Both visible to client.
   In case of RequestDispatcher, there's one request from browser to s1. Internal rerouting from s1 to s2 does not count as 
   as a separate request.
