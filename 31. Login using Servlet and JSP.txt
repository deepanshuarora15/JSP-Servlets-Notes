1. Http is stateless protocol. So login credentials management is the responsibility of the developer.
2. We use session management for this.
3. Cookies can also be used. But cookies get stored on client side. So we prefer Sessions instead.
4. Cookies are better for e-commerce modules.
5. If there is a login page and welcome page:
   websitename/login.jsp
   websitename/welcome.jsp
6. If we directly open the welcome page and session says that person has not logged in,
   then we will redirect the person to login page. Else we will allow him on welcome page.
7. We don't store the password in Session, just the username we store. 
8. On logout button click, we remove the username attribute from the session and redirect back to login page.
9. Note: we need to remove the back button functionality, to prevent pages from getting opened after log out. 
   We can do that by remvoing cached files from the browser.
