1. In servlets, we had to define the service() method. had to define objects for HttpServletResponse and HttpServletRequest interface.
2. So why do we even learn servlet? Why not learn JSP directly?
3. Reason: Tomcat does not understand JSP. Itacts as a container to run servlets only. Whatever JSP code you write,
   that gets converted to servlets internally.
4. In JSP, we do not make objects for sessions and cookies too. Everything is there in terms of implicit objects, already
   available for our usage
5. <% %> is known as scriplet.
6. Declaration tag
   <%!
   int value = 1; // here we do declarations
   %>
7. Directive Tags
   <%@page
   // Here we import packages
   %>
8. <%=k%> //  Expression tag equiavalent to out.println();
