1. PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();
   out.println("<html><body>");
2. This is problematic to format and configure. When the code grows big, it becomes an issue to track things like where did you 
   miss the closing tag.
3. Here HTML is bound within Java code, which is not good.
4. Java came up with a solution known as JSP. Here we have reverse situation. We have HTML pages and throw Java in there.
5. JSP can do everything, that you have been doing till now using Servlets.
6. 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Sample JSP</title>
</head>
<body>
	Hello World
	<form action="Add.jsp" method="post">
		Enter 1st number : <input type="text" name="num1"/><br/>
		Enter 2nd number : <input type="text" name="num2"/><br/>
		<input type="submit"/>
	</form>
</body>
</html>

<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1"
    pageEncoding="ISO-8859-1"%>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="ISO-8859-1">
<title>Insert title here</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="cyan">
<% 
	int i = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("num1"));
	int j = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("num2"));
	int k = i + j;
	out.println("Output is "+k);
%>
</body>
</html>

7. Imp: The best advantage here is that, neither did we have to do XML configuration or Web annotations. We just defined 
   JSP here and tada, just added form action = "Add.jsp". That's it
