1. Till now whatever we have used is HTTP protocol based.
2. There are 5 requests possible in Http:
   a. Get
   b. Post
   c. Put
   d. Delete
   e. Options
3. Apart from action attribute in form tag, we also have another attribute called as method.
   Default value for method is get
4. <form action ="add" method="get">
   </form>


5. Problem: When we use the get protocol, everything gets passed inside the query string and is visible in the address bar.
6. Solution: change the method to "post". Now URL won't contain the arguements and your submitted data would be safe
7. When to use get and when to use post?
   a. Get: When you want to fetch data from the server
   b. post: When you want to post data to the server. Eg: entering username and password for login	
8. Drawback of this method: using inspect element, user can change your post method in the form tag to get method.
   Solution: Till now we have been using public void service() method inside the servlet.
9. There are 2 more methods:
   a. doPost : exact same signature as service(). Just rename the method to doPost()
   b. doGet: exact same signature as service(). Just rename the method to doPost()
