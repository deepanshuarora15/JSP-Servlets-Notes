1. Servlet works faster than JSP.
2. But JSP are faster to write by programmer.
3. Jsp are slow for the first time, because they need to converted to corresponding Servlet
4. Also it is not a good practice to write your business logic inside JSP. Only View should be there in JSP.
5. MVC pattern:
   a. Client interacts with the app and pushes a request to controller.
   b. Controller calls the Model and pushes a model object to View.
   c. View takes whatever it requires to show from the Model.
   d. Voew gets returned to the client.
6. Models are nothing but POJOs.
7. All business logic is written inside controller. All processing that needs to be done, is done by the controller.

8. Apart from MVC nothing is required theoretically, but practically.
   Controller has to be connected with Service and Service inturn needs to be connected with DAO. DAO gets connected to database then,
   via the help of jdbc.
