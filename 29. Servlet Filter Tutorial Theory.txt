1. We can have filters for:
   a. log
   b. Transaction
   c. Security
2. Most of these filters are common for most servlets and hence it is better to separate them out. This wy, if we add new servlets in
   future, we can just plug them in, without making any changes in filters.
3. Filters are independent of each other and are invisible to each other.
4. All these filters need to be added to web.xml file.
