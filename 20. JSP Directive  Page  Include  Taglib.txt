1. Within JSP directives, we have 3 different things: 
   a. @page
   b. @include
   c. @taglib

2. @page used for 
   a. imports
   b. Exception handling

3. @taglib
   Eg: when we use Srping framework, @taglib comes into picture. HTML tags are default tags. Any tags that you want to use,
       apart from HTML tags, need to be added to @taglib
4. <%@ page attributes %>
   Attributes list contains:
   a. language = "scripting language"  // by defualt it's java
   b. extends = "className"
   c. import = "comma separated importList"
   d. session = "true | false"  // set true if you want to have session management
   e. autoFlush = "true | false" // If we have buffer in place, and we want to be able to receive data after buffer is full. Set true
   f. contentType = "ctinfo" // what are we gonna return to client? Html / pdf/image etc.
   g. errorPage = "error_url" 
   h. isErrorPage = "true | false"
   i. info  = "information"
   j. isELIgnored = "true | false" // EL means expression language
   k. isThreadSafe = "true | false" 

5. it's not a good practice to use SQL queries inside JSP page.

6. import attribute , you can use as many times as you'd like. All other attributes can be defined only once.
7. <%@ include file  "header.jsp" %>
8. @Taglib
	<%@ taglib uri="uri" prefix="fx" %>
